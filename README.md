## Project Descripion:
In this project our team designed 2 Natural Language Processing machine learning models to classify fake news articles. For our baseline model we use a logistic regression model and TF-IDF
techniques to classify fake news articles with 94% accuracy. We also apply a pre-trained BERT model for classification, and discover that the more complex model preforms 
with lower accuracy.
